# simpleml

simpleml is a lightweight machine learning library I created from scratch using only numpy to explore the topic. The following are currently supported.

1. Feed Forward Neural Networks
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. LVQ

In addition the following utilities are provided
1. 13 metrics for evaluation
2. A Z score standardization Scaler
3. A split function for splitting training and testing data

Please check out demo.ipynb for code examples.

## Development Notes
* KNN and LVQ documentation is in progress. Expect some minor changes to the classes as well.
* Adding testing to metrics
